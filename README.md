## Getting started
### Getting github-package-registry packages NAV-IT
Some packages used in this repo is uploaded to the Github Package Registry which requires authentication. It can, for example, be solved like this in Gradle:
```
val githubUser: String by project
val githubPassword: String by project
repositories {
    maven {
        credentials {
            username = githubUser
            password = githubPassword
        }
        setUrl("https://maven.pkg.github.com/navikt/syfosm")
    }
}
```

`githubUser` and `githubPassword` can be put into a separate file `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with the following content:

```                                                     
githubUser=x-access-token
githubPassword=[token]
```

Replace `[token]` with a personal access token with scope `read:packages`.

Alternatively, the variables can be configured via environment variables:

* `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_githubUser`
* `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_githubPassword`

or the command line:

```
./gradlew -PgithubUser=x-access-token -PgithubPassword=[token]
```
